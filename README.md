# E-Commerce DB
In this project I have created a Database for a E-Commerce Website using the Oracle Database 18c and populated it with randomly generated values using PL/SQL scripts. Using Oracle Apex I created a Dashboard with charts and graphs to track and monitor daily Activity based on the data updated/inserted eachtime. Used PL/SQL Scripts to get the data for visualization. This will be helpful for tracking day-to-day activities and generating daily reports for the Organisation. Implemented triggers to Impose security authorizations and Preventing invalid transactions.
